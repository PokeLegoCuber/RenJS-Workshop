# RenJS-Workshop

The purpose of this repository is to give beginners of RenJS the necessary support to build out their first visual novel game.

There are 2 ways to get your RenJS project up and running on your machine.
* Setting up a [local server](https://github.com/lunafromthemoon/RenJS/blob/master/README.md) as show here
* Alternatively you can do this
	1. Use the Firefox Browser
	2. Type ```about:config``` into the url bar
	3. Click the button that says ```Accept the Risk and Continue```
	4. In the search bar that says ```Search preference name```, type in ```privacy.file_unique_origin```
	5. Double click the box so that it turns from ```true``` to ```false```
	6. Open the ```index.html``` in the FireFox Browser
	7. Your game should render :smiley:
